# Skip-Gram Word Embedding Model in PyTorch

This project implements a Skip-Gram Word Embedding Model using PyTorch. The Skip-Gram model is a popular technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for learning word embeddings. Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic similarity between words based on their context in a given corpus.

The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook, which provides an interactive environment for experimentation and visualization of the model training process.

## Overview

- **Notebook:** `Skip_Gram_Word_Embedding_Model.ipynb`
  - This notebook contains the complete implementation of the Skip-Gram Word Embedding Model using PyTorch.
  - It includes sections for data preprocessing, vocabulary creation, model architecture definition, training loop, and evaluation.
  - Visualizations such as loss plots and cosine similarity comparisons are provided to analyze the model performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShikharKunal/Skip_Gram_Model.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Skip_Gram_Model
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
